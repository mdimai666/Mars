# SqlNode

SqlNode is a node for executing SQL queries to a database and retrieving structured data.

The node allows you to:
- write a custom SQL query or use parameters,
- execute a query against a selected data source,
- return the result as a rowset or object,
- use the query result in subsequent nodes.
